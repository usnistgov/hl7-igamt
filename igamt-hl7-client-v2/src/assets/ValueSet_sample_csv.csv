Comment,Updated based on HL70396 in HL7 v2.8.2; Added HCPTNUCC to support legacy implementation guides. HCPT was set up for use in HL7 V3.  Later HL7 decided to have this be an external code table (not maintained by HL7) so it was abandoned for V2.  The plan was to set up HCPTNUCC for this purpose but that activity was not completed.  ,,,
